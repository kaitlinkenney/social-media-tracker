# Social Media Tracker
Software that will discipline your social media addiction.

## Description

Do you ever feel that you scroll through social media too long? While social media apps are great for keeping in touch with friends, they can sometimes waste too much time while you could be doing something more productive. Use this application if you would like to set a time limit to your daily scrolling.

## Usage
Navigate to the application through the deployed link below. Select how much time you want to spend on social media sites from the dropdown menu. Start the timer and go to any site(s) available through the links provided. When time is up, you will be sent a reminder to take a break!
